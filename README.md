# Hello, World

The phrase "Hello, World" began at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. brian kernighan used it in 1972 in a tutorial for the B language to demonstrate the simplest possible output. the example showed how a program could take a basic instruction and display text, making it a clear starting point for learners.

in 1978, kernighan and dennis ritchie included the same phrase in The C Programming Language. that book spread the example widely because C became influential in system programming. the phrase worked well since it was short, unambiguous, and demonstrated a functioning program without extra concepts.

as new languages were created, the tradition carried over. developers kept using "Hello, World" as the standard first program to confirm that the compiler, interpreter, or environment was set up correctly. the example became a universal baseline for testing and teaching across programming.

## 2026

Happy New Year! i havent opened github in quite a long time (perhaps since last year), the new implementation (PureScript) is probably the final commit on this repo as i cultivate increasingly profound indolence.
