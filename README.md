# Hello, World

The phrase "Hello, World" began at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. brian kernighan used it in 1972 in a tutorial for the B language to demonstrate the simplest possible output. the example showed how a program could take a basic instruction and display text, making it a clear starting point for learners.

in 1978, kernighan and dennis ritchie included the same phrase in The C Programming Language. that book spread the example widely because C became influential in system programming. the phrase worked well since it was short, unambiguous, and demonstrated a functioning program without extra concepts.

as new languages were created, the tradition carried over. developers kept using "Hello, World" as the standard first program to confirm that the compiler, interpreter, or environment was set up correctly. the example became a universal baseline for testing and teaching across programming.

## Note

You may use this to learn about a specific language. (im slowly falling in love with Golang, so if someday the main language becomes Go, thats expected, but its not going to happen because my love for Crystal will never be broken)
